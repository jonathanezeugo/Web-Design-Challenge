Web Design Challenge

Data has the best meaning when it can be put in pictures or visualized. It is even more powerful when it can be shared with others who can comprehend its meaning. Putting together the many and varied tools that make this possible is a rigorous but rewarding experience. This challenge built on a previous challenge on by using new knowledge about HTML and CSS to create a webpage that is published to present visuals of some weather data analysis. The resulting webpage can be found here: https://jonathanezeugo.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/


Background

From a previous challenge on weather, python and API queries helped retrieve weather data of over 500 cities around the world. A series of scatter plots were made to showcase the relationship between latitude locations and certain weather parameters, namely:

1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The four scatter plots generated from this weather analysis is now published on a webpage using html and css tools. The key question these plots help to answer is: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" The visualizations on each webpage helps to provide logical answers based on the plots generated using the data obtained. The data file contrived from the API queries on python used city position coordinates to obtain city locations and weather data. 







This HW will focus on creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a previous assignment. Here we'll be plotting weather data from a CSV file.
